# Predicting Hospital Readmissions for Patients with Diabetes
### The Problem
Healthcare, which has long been an important issue, has become an even more popular topic over the last several years since 2010, when President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. One reason why is the amount that the United States spends on healthcare services each year. It is estimated that we spend roughly 18% of our GDP on healthcare services, which equates to about **$3.5 trillion** or **$10,739** per person.

In March 2018, the American Diabetes Association released its findings from a study which explored the economic costs of diabetes. According to this study, it is estimated that the total costs of diabetes rose to **$327** billion per year in 2017, **$237 billion** of which can be attributed to direct medical costs and $90 billion due to lost productivity. People with diagnosed diabetes pay approximately **2.3x** more than people who do not have a diagnosis of diabetes. 

In 2015, diabetes was listed as the underlying cause of death on **79,535** death certificates, making it the **7th leading cause of death** in the United States. Further, it was mentioned on 252,806 certificates as one of the causes. Diabetes may also be underreported since only about 35-40% of people with diabetes who died had diabetes mentioned on their certificate, and only about 10-15% had it listed as the underlying cause of death.

With all of these statistics in mind, I want to explore the health and economic burdens that diabetes causes on communities throughout the country using data from the CDC. I then want to explore a dataset made publicly available from University of California at Irvine through the UCI Machine Learning Repository to predict hospital readmissions for patients with diagnosed diabetes.

### The Data
* The CDC has created a [toolkit](https://nccd.cdc.gov/Toolkit/DiabetesBurden/Home/Index) that explores the Economic Burden and the Health Burden that diabetes causes on states across the country for the years from 2011-2013.
* The University of California at Irvine (UC) released a dataset on [hospital readmissions at 130 hospitals for the years 1999-2008.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008) This original dataset was pulled from the Health Facts database, a national data warehouse that collects clinical records across participating U.S. hospitals that use the Cerner Electronic Health Record (EHR). The dataset was filtered down by the Departments of Computer Science, Health Administration, and Biostatistics at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) as part of a study exploring the [effect of the HbA1c measurement on hospital readmission rates.](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/781670/)
